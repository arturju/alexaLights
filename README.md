# alexaParticleLights
My original intent was to integrate a Particle Photon board with an Amazon Echo device to control some devices using voice command. In the process, I found projects by people who had done similar things (see references at the end) and they helped lead the way. This is my attemt at bringing together a few of the things I found in different projects.

The diagram below gives a gist of what is accomplished by this project.
